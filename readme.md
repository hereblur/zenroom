# Zenroom App show case.

### Frontend
all codes are in `/front`, except the `bower_component` which are library.

### Backend/API

Most of my implementation files are on these directories

/zenapi/app/Http/Controllers
/zenapi/app/Models/
/zenapi/tests
/zenapi/database

the rests are mostly framworks files.
